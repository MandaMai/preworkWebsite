<h2>First Post</h2>
<h3 class="journalDate">7/31/2017</h3>
<p class="journalMarker">In this house we believe in magic, we go on unexpected journeys once upon a time in galaxies far far away.  We assemble and defned doing wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff going where no man has gone before.  We know the answer to everything is 42 and that family don't end in blood.  We are high functioning sociopaths and the odds are ever in our favor.  We do cosplay and passion marathons and conventions.  We aim to misbehave and we don't care what others think because in this house we do geek and I solemly swear that I am up to no good.</p>
<p class="journalMarker">This is my first attempt at a webpage in a long time and I definitely think I am much more better off than I have ever been in the past.  I have made websites before, but this one is going to be mine and it is going to be fantasic.  I like that I will be able to create anything I want. I look forward to being able to connect it to a database so I can store blog posts and comments, form data, and whatnot so I can truly create a more versatile and interactive form.  Good night!</p>

<h2>Winter is definitely not coming</h2>
<h3 class="journalDate">8/1/2017</h3>
<p class="journalThin">I have now gotten three messages about the high temperatures coming this way in the next few days.  It has been this hot all summer in Spokane, but apparently this is not something they are very used to on this side of the state.  They had tips, tricks, and all of that fun stuff with ideas and instructions to keep you cooler when the going gets hot.  Seattle doesn't really have a huge air conditioner thing so I am sure a lot of people will be trying to figure out how to get access to one, even if it is just temporary.  I personally plan on utilizing the pool, the ice I have in the fridge, and ice cream to keep myself cool for these next few days.</p>
<p class="journalThin">It is proving to be much more difficult than I thought to sell my house and also try to take care of things while I am not there.  Specifically the pool.  The pool guys have always been flaky but this year is so much worse. They never show up on teh day they are supposed to, they don't communicate anything, and they are even worse at calling me to let me know what is going on.  I know it isn't her fault but really they should be much better than this.</p>
